Intro to CS lessons targeted for middle schoolers.

Most of these were adapted from the Develop Summer Academy 2017 Intro to Computer Science course. Learn more at http://develop.academy.

# YAEPL
We started the class using an educational programming language named YAEPL. There is a reference sheet for the language inside this repository that was provided to the students, and you can learn more about YAEPL at its repository page here: https://github.com/matthewsot/asm-yaepl

After the first day, we transitioned to using Javascript exclusively.

We also used a custom, cross-platform application to code in, that supports both YAEPLE and Javascript, has some graphical helper functions for the Hangman project, has a command-line-like interface (including support for "write" and "prompt"), and is avalable here: https://github.com/matthewsot/yaepl-app
